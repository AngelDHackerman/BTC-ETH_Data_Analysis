## **Datasets**
### Overview

The datasets include daily prices for Bitcoin and the S&P 500 from **September 2014 to May 2024**.

### Key Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Removed missing values to ensure data integrity, as they represented less than 1% of the dataset.
2. **Removing Weekend Data**:
   - Aligned Bitcoin's data with the S&P 500, which only trades on business days.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and ensured temporal alignment between datasets.


## **Project Workflow**

### Step 1 & 2: Initial Investigation
- Performed exploratory analysis using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to understand the datasets.
- Combined relevant files to create unified datasets for Bitcoin and S&P 500 index.
- Ensured high data quality by removing null and duplicate rows.
- Change the data type in columns like 'Date' to `datetime64` for better handling with the datasets.
- By using the Interquartile Range method (IQR) some outliers were found in both datasets, they were keep in order to see market behaviors during extreme events. 
- Data was exported one file for BTC and S&P500 

See the further details in the notebooks for these steps: 
* [Initial Exploration S&P 500](./1_Inital_Exploration_SP_500.ipynb)
* [Initial Exploration BTC](./1_Initial_Exploraion_BTC.ipynb)
* [BTC and S&P Comparation](./2_BTC_SP500_Comparation.ipynb)

### Step 3: Quality Evaluation

- Verified data integrity by checking for **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **logical value ranges**.
- Datasets are temporally, ensuring both had identical date ranges.
- Data is clean and it is consisten and reliable in both datasets.

### Step 4: Temporal Analysis

- **Objective**: Identify price trends over weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals.

- **Findings**:
  - **Price Trends**:
    - Bitcoin shows high short-term variability, while the S&P 500 has stable, consistent growth. **(See [Figure 1](#figure-1))**
    - Long-term trends highlight Bitcoin's exponential growth and volatility. **(See [Figure 2](#figure-2))**
  - **Volume Trends**:
    - Bitcoin's transaction volume correlates with periods de high price volatility, often spiking during market rallies or crashes. 
    - The S&P 500's transaction volume remains relatively stable, aligning with its consistent growth.
    - Significant volume surges in Bitcoin often precede price reversals, suggesting a strong relationship between market sentiment and trading activity. **(See [Figure 3](#figure-3) and [Figure 4](#figure-4))**
  - **Comparative Insights**:
    - Bitcoin's volume is highly responsive to market news and macroeconomic events, amplifying its volatility.
    - S&P 500's trading volume shows resilience and lower sensitivity to short-term news, indicating a mature and stable market structure.
    - In both cases in January 2018 price and volume of bitcoin surpassed S&P's metrics, and has stayed like that since then, for the moment... **(See Figure 1 and 3)**

# The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 is higher in periods of economic crisis, is this true?

### Insights Analysis (Step 5.1):

- **Objective**: The objective of this analysis was to explore the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 Index during the COVID-19 crisis (March 2020 to December 2021), energy and supplies crisis (2021-2022), financial crisis (2023-2024).

- **Specifically, the analysis focuses on**:
  - Understanding the behavior of BTC and the S&P 500 during key economic periods.
  - Comparing price and volume trends and correlations to identify potential patterns or anomalies.
  - Highlighting insights that could inform investment or risk management strategies.

#### Understanding Correlations

  1. **Positive Correlation**:
    - If the correlation is closer to **1**, it indicates a **direct positive correlation**, meaning that as one variable increases, the other also increases.

  2. **Negative Correlation**:
    - If the correlation is closer to **-1**, it indicates a **direct inverse correlation**, meaning that as one variable increases, the other decreases.

  3. **No Correlation**:
    - The closer the correlation is to **0**, the weaker the relationship, indicating **little to no correlation** between the two variables.

### Observations and Conclusions

1. **Overall Trends**:
   - BTC and the S&P 500 exhibit distinct behaviors, with BTC showing higher volatility compared to the stable movement of the S&P 500.
   - Both assets show significant price movements during major economic periods, such as the COVID-19 crisis.

   - The S&P 500 showed relatively stable trends, highlighting resilience compared to BTC's heightened sensitivity to global market conditions.
   - **Correlation Insight**: The correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 **slightly weakened (0.60)** during this period but remained positive, suggesting partial market alignment amidst external shocks. **(See [Figure 6, lower section](#figure-6))** 

<a id='Economic-crisis'></a>

4. **Economic Crisis (2023‚Äì2024)**:
   - BTC demonstrated significant growth and maintained a higher price trajectory, reflecting increased interest from speculative investors seeking alternative assets. **(See [Figure 7, upper section](#figure-7))**
   - The S&P 500 displayed stable trends with gradual recovery, **reinforcing its role as an indicator of economic stability.**
   - **Correlation Insight**: Correlation **strengthened (0.90)** during this period, indicating **increasing interdependence between BTC and traditional markets** as BTC becomes more integrated into global finance. **(See [Figure 7, lower section](#figure-7))**

<a id='volumen-analysis'></a>

5. **Volume Analysis**:
   - BTC trading volume surged during periods of high price volatility, showing sensitivity to market events.
   - S&P 500 volumes, though less volatile, also increased during market uncertainty.
   - Overall, seems like the correlation "volumen trading-price" between bitcoin and S&P 500 is **Not very strong** and they are barely correlated. **(See [Figure 8](#figure-8))**

### The "Red Shadow" in Correlation Graphs

The **red shadow** in the correlation graphs represents the **confidence interval** for the linear regression line. This interval indicates the range within which the true regression line is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence (typically 95%). **A narrower red shadow** suggests **higher confidence** and less variability in the data, while a **wider shadow** indicates **greater uncertainty and variability** in the relationship between BTC and the S&P 500 prices.

These observations and graphical insights collectively highlight how BTC and the S&P 500 respond under various economic conditions, demonstrating distinct behaviors and evolving correlations over time.
